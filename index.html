I felt very alienated in high school so I wrote a movie loosely based on my high school experience. 
I realized that I liked high school movies which showcased hedonism and depravity. 
I systematically watched them all and took extensive notes. 
I especially liked the <a href="https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/tdr/vol8/iss1/1/" target="_blank">sex comedies of the 1980s</a>
. My school was not like a raunchy teen movie, as far as I could tell.
At the time, I worried that this was because of political correctness.
